    "1. Since this solution is using BFS traversal to traverse the binary tree level by level, it can make sure the nodes closer are visted and checked before going to the nodes at deeper levels.\n",
    "2. We set up 'visited' and 'queue' at the begining, which are initialized to track encountered and visited values, and with the root node.\n",
    "3. Then we processing the root nodes level by level, as adding up the root node to the 'visited' set and enqueue the left & right children of root. \n",
    "4. In the comparison step, we checked each node value vs. visited set. When the value if found in visited set, the function will return the value as the closet duplicate to the root and the function ends. However, if no value is found, it will be added to the set, then move to the node's children, until no duplicated found after all nodes are checked through, the function will return -1.\n",
    "5. As we can see, this function uses queue set to allow process root nodes level-by-level while utlizes 'visited' set for an effecient investigation on duplicate values, returning the needed output as problem stated."
